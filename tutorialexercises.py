# basically exercises i did for a python tutorial video
#Specifically, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc

# this file is perfect for summarizing the tutorial

# this is creating a variable that stores stuff from the input function
name = input("What's your name? ")
color = input("What's your favorite color? ")

# basically prints the stuff stored in the variables
print(f"{name} likes {color}")

# Pounds to kilograms calculator, the results are rounded up.
weight = input("What's your weight? (lbs/pounds) ")

print(str(int(weight) // 2.205) + " (This is the ROUNDED answer)")
print(str(int(weight) / 2.205) + " (This is the UNROUNDED answer)")

#im too lazy to complete this shit LMAO
